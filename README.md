## QuizTrivia Web App
### Team bitwise 
### What it does 📅
QuizTrivia is basically a web app, where you can play quizzes with a time limit. you'll encounter 10 questions and you have only 10 sec for each question.
### How we built it 💻
We built our design on canva and we used HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
### Challenges we ran into 👊
We struggle a lot to come up with reasonable solutions and there is a timer part where we had to show the actual time to user not only in console.
### What we learned 📚
Throughout the hackathon, we gained some experience in working on a team.
### What's next for ScheduLens ➡️
We would like to expand some features like storing their quizzes data on local storage so that they know how well they are performing.
